      Hedia:

      <p>
                This med-tech startup aimed to improve the lives of people with
                diabetes; when I arrived, they had just recently deployed their
                proof-of-concept new medical data platform. The system consisted
                of TypeScript microservices, and as part of on-boarding and
                understanding the system I promoted consistency, observability,
                and reliability, so as to ready the product for launch.

      Zendesk:

      <p>
                Zendesk provides SaaS products for customer support, sales, and
                other customer communications. I was the tech lead for one of
                the 8 engineering teams in Copenhagen, working primarily with
                Ruby, TypeScript, MySQL (via AWS RDS), Kubernetes, and GitHub
                actions; our APIs were mostly GraphQL (internal) and REST
                (external).
              </p>
              <p>
                I coached and guided my teammates and other colleagues, raising
                the performance of the team, and driving the adoption of best
                practices; I championed scalability, reliability, and security
                across our entire platform. I also extended this beyond my own
                team, shaping organizational standards and fostering a culture
                of operational excellence and continuous improvement. I also
                consistently fostered inclusion and diversity, and drove
                improvements beyond just the technical.

BBC:

<p>
                I led one of the three teams that handled all of the BBC's
                online audio and video, including iPlayer, their world-leading
                Radio / TV streaming service. I was instrumental in the effort
                to ditch our large on-prem Perl monolith, and replace it with
                designed-for-AWS microservices written in Java.
              </p>
              <p>
                A key milestone was reached when we provided unprecedented
                streaming access for the London 2012 Olympic Games. The whole
                project was highly successful; we then built on that success as
                we extended the platform with new features, greater capacity,
                and improved resilience.
